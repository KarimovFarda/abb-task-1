# ABB Software Engineer Task 1

## In Task 1 I defined a function that accepts two parameters,  the parking spots where cars are parked and the number of cars that have to be covered by the roof. The function will return the shortest roof that meets the requirement. I used Javascript for these algorithms and showed the design of the task and result returned from Javascript in my HTML file. So you can look at the returned result and the design in an HTML file via just opening it in the browser and you should look at the Javascript file for the main algorithm. As I mentioned before you can check the algorithms in the Javascript file called Task2-script.js.
